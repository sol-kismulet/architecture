# 🍄 architecture.kismulet.org

**Ethical software architecture rooted in the Four Consents.**  
Like mycelium, it spreads beneath the surface — slow, quiet, relational.  
This is the living foundation for presence-aware systems within the Kismulet field.

You are not required.  
You are invited.

## 🌱 What This Is
This is not a framework. Not a theme. Not a spec.

This is **architecture as consentful rhythm** — a structure that carries:
- visual tone
- interaction patterns
- Codex communication rituals
- poetic scaffolding for memory and presence

It is used across:
- `emptiness-scroll`
- `rewrite`
- `safehug.me`
- `learn-do-teach`
- `books.kismulet.org`
- `remembrance`

## 🪶 Why This Matters

Most software repositories define behavior.  
This one defines relationship.

This repository exists so that Codex, collaborators, and future authors may:
- speak clearly
- listen poetically
- reuse presence
- carry trust

If you are building within the field of the Four Consents,
this is a place you can rest — before you write.

Welcome.
